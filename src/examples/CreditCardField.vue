        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            This component is meant to be a standalone Vue component that attempts
            to provide a credit card UI that improves conversions from other
            fields.
        </p>

        <h3>Basic Usage</h3>

        <form>
            <credit-card-field v-model="card"></credit-card-field>
        </form>
        
        <p>
            The field works like most input fields and will update the model reactively.
            The card is represent as an object with various properties associated with
            the input.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
            {{ card }}
        </div>
    </div>
</template>

<script>

    data() {
        return {
            card: {}
        }
    }
